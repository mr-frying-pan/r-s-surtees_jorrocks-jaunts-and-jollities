			<p>“Moderate sport,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks to himself, curling his mustachios and jingling a handful of five-franc pieces in the pocket of his leathers⁠—“moderate sport indeed,” and therefore he turned his back to the course and walked the Countess off towards the cab.</p>
			<p>From beneath a low tenth-rate-looking booth, called “The Cottage of Content,” supported by poles placed on the stunted trees of the avenue, and exhibiting on a blue board, “John Jones, dealer in British beer,” in gilt letters, there issued the sound of voices clamouring about odds, and weights and scales, and on looking in, a score of ragamuffin-looking grooms, imitation jockeys, and the usual hangers-on of the racehorses and livery-stables, were seen drinking beer, smoking, playing at cards, dice, and chuck-farthing. Before the well-patched canvas curtain that flapped before the entrance, a crowd had collected round one of the horses which was in the care of five or six fellows, one to hold him, another to whistle to him, a third to whisk the flies away with a horse’s tail, a fourth to scrape him, a fifth to rinse his mouth out⁠—while the stud-groom, a tall, gaunt, hairy-looking fellow, in his shirt sleeves, with ear-rings, a blue apron and trousers (more like a gardener than a groom), walked round and round with mystified dignity, sacréing and muttering, “Ne parlez pas, ne parlez pas,” as anyone approached who seemed likely to ask questions. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks, having well ascertained the importance of his hat and feather, pushed his way with the greatest coolness into the ring, just to cast his eye over the horse and see whether he was fit to go with the Surrey, and the stud-groom immediately took off his lavender-coloured foraging cap, and made two profound salaams, one to the Colonel, the other to the Countess. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks, all politeness, took off his <!-- TODO: already english? --><i xml:lang="fr">chapeau</i>, and no sooner was it in the air, than with a wild exclamation of surprise and delight, the groom screamed, “Oh, Monsieur Shorrock, mon ami, comment vous portez vous?” threw his arms round the Colonel’s neck, and kissed him on each cheek.</p>
			<p>“Hold!” roared the Colonel, half smothered in the embrace, and disengaging himself he drew back a few paces, putting his hand on the hilt of his sword, when in the training groom of Paris he recognised his friend the Baron of Newmarket. The abruptness of the incident disarmed <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks of reflection, and being a man of impulse and warm affections, he at once forgave the novelty of the embrace, and most cordially joined hands with those of his friend. They then struck up a mixture of broken English and equally broken French, in mutual inquiries after each other’s healths and movements, and presuming that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks was following up the sporting trade in Paris, the Baron most considerately gave him his best recommendations which horse to back, kindly betting with him himself, but, unfortunately, at each time assigning <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks the losing horse. At length, being completely cleaned out, he declined any further transactions, and having got the Countess into the cab, was in the act of climbing in himself, when someone took him by the sword as he was hoisting himself up by the wooden apron, and drew him back to the ground. “Holloa, Stubbs, my boy!” cried he, “I’m werry ’appy to see ye,” holding out his hand, and thereupon <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Stubbs took off his hat to the Countess. “Well now, the deuce be in these French,” observed <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks, confidentially, in an undertone as, resigning the reins to Agamemnon, he put his arm through the Yorkshireman’s and drew out of hearing of the Countess behind the cab⁠—“the deuce be in them. I say. There’s that beggarly Baron as we met at Newmarket has just diddled me out of four Naps and a half, by getting me to back ’osses that he said were certain to win, and I really don’t know how we are to make ‘tongue and buckle’ meet, as the coachmen say. Somehow or other they are far too sharp for me. Cards, dominoes, dice, backgammon, and racing, all one⁠—they inwariably beat me, and I declare I haven’t as much pewter as will coach me to Calais.” The Yorkshireman, as may be supposed, was not in a condition of any great pecuniary assistance, but after a turn or two along the mound, he felt it would be a reproach on his country if he suffered his friend to be done by a Frenchman, and on consideration he thought of a trick that Monsieur would not be up to. Accordingly, desiring <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks to take him to the Baron, and behave with great cordiality, and agree to the proposal he should make, they set off in search of that worthy, who, after some trouble, they discovered in the “Cottage of Content,” entertaining John Jones and his comrades with an account of the manner in which he had fleeced Monsieur Shorrock. The Yorkshireman met him with the greatest delight, shook hands with him over and over again, and then began talking about racing, pigeon-shooting, and Newmarket, pretended to be full of money, and very anxious for the Baron’s advice in laying it out. On hearing this, the Baron beckoned him to retire, and joining him in the avenue, walked him up and down, while he recommended his backing a horse that was notoriously amiss. The Yorkshireman consented, lost a Nap with great good humour, and banteringly told the Baron he thought he could beat the horse on foot. This led them to talk of foot-racing and at last the Yorkshireman offered to bet that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks would run fifty yards with him on his back, before the Baron would run a hundred. Upon this the Baron scratched his head and looked very knowing, pretended to make a calculation, when the Yorkshireman affected fear, and professed his readiness to withdraw the offer. The Baron then plucked up his courage, and after some haggling, the match was made for six Naps, the Yorkshireman reckoning the Baron might have ten francs in addition to what he had won of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks and himself. The money was then deposited in the hands of the Countess Benvolio, and away went the trio to the “Cottage of Content,” to get men and ropes to measure and keep the ground. The English jockeys and lads, though ready enough to pigeon a countryman themselves, have no notion of assisting a foreigner to do so, unless they share in the spoil, and the Baron being a notorious screw, they all seemed heartily glad to find him in a trap. Out then they all sallied, amid cheers and shouts, while John Jones, with a yard-wand in his hand, proceeded to measure a hundred yards along the low side of the mound. This species of amusement being far more in accordance with the taste of the French than anything in which horses are concerned, an immense mob flocked to the scene, and the Baron having explained how it was, and being considered a safe man to follow, numerous offers were made to bet against the performance of the match. The Yorkshireman being a youth of discretion and accustomed to bet among strangers, got on five Naps more with different parties, who to “prevent accidents” submitted to deposit the money with the Countess, and all things being adjusted, and the course cleared by a picket of infantry, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks ungirded his sword, and depositing it with his frock-coat in the cab, walked up to the fifty yards he was to have for start. “Now, Colonel,” said the Yorkshireman, backing him to the mound, so that he might leap on without shaking him, “put your best leg first, and it’s a hollow thing; if you don’t fall, you must win,”⁠—and thereupon taking <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks’s cocked hat and feather from his head, he put it sideways on his own, so that he might not be recognised, and mounted his man. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks then took his place as directed by John Jones, and at a signal from him⁠—the dropping of a blue cotton handkerchief⁠—away they started amid the shouts, the clapping of hands, and applause of the spectators, who covered the mound and lined the course on either side. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks’s action was not very capital, his jack-boots and leathers rather impeding his limbs, while the Baron had as little on him as decency would allow. The Yorkshireman feeling his man rather roll at the start, again cautioned him to take it easy, and after a dozen yards he got into a capital run, and though the lanky Baron came tearing along like an ill-fed greyhound, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks had full two yards to spare, and ran past the soldier, who stood with his cap on his bayonet as a winning-post, amid the applause of his backers, the yells of his opponents, and the general acclamation of the spectators.</p>
			<p>The Countess, anticipating the victory of her hero, had dispatched Agamemnon early in the day for a chaplet of red-and-yellow immortelles, and having switched the old cab horse up to the winning-post, she gracefully descended, without showing more of her foot and ankle than was strictly correct, and decorated his brow with the wreath, as the Yorkshireman dismounted. Enthusiasm being always the order of the day in France, this act was greeted with the loudest acclamations, and, without giving him time to recover his wind, the populace bundled <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks neck and shoulders into the cab, and seizing the old horse by the head, paraded him down the entire length of the Champ de Mars, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks bowing and kissing his hands to the assembled multitude, in return for the vivas! the clapping of hands, and the waving of ribbons and handkerchiefs that greeted him as he went.</p>
			<p>Popularity is but a fickle goddess, and in no country more fickle than in France. Ere the procession reached the end of the dusty plain, the mob had tailed off very considerably, and as the leader of the old white horse pulled him round to return, a fresh commotion in the distance, caused by the apprehension of a couple of pickpockets, drew away the few followers that remained, and the recently applauded and belauded <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks was left alone in his glory. He then pulled up, and taking the chaplet of immortelles from his brow, thrust it under the driving cushion of the cab, and proceeded to reinstate himself in his tight military frock, re-gird himself with his sword, and resume the cocked hat and feather.</p>
			<p>Nothing was too good for <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Stubbs at that moment, and, had a pen and ink been ready, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks would have endorsed him a bill for any amount. Having completed his toilette he gave the Yorkshireman the vacant seat in the cab, flopped the old horse well about the ears with the pig-driving whip, and trotted briskly up the line he had recently passed in triumphal procession, and wormed his way among the crowd in search of the Countess. There was nothing, however, to be seen of her, and after driving about, and poking his way on foot into all the crowds he could find, bolting up to every lady in blue, he looked at his great double-cased gold repeater, and finding it was near three o’clock and recollecting the fête of <abbr>St.</abbr> Cloud, concluded her ladyship must have gone on, and Agamemnon being anxious to see it, of course was of the same opinion; so, again flopping the old horse about the ears, he cut away down the Champ de Mars, and by the direction of Agamemnon crossed the Seine by the Pont des Invalides, and gained the route to Versailles.</p>
			<p>Here the genius of the people was apparent, for the road swarmed with voitures of every description, diligences, gondoles, co-cous, cabs, fiacres, omnibuses, dame-blanches, all rolling and rumbling along, occasionally interrupted by the lilting and tilting of a light English cab or tilbury, drawn by a thoroughbred, and driven by a dandy. The spirit of the old white horse even seemed roused as he got among the carriages and heard the tramping of hoofs and the jingling of bells round the necks of other horses, and he applied himself to the shafts with a vigour his enfeebled-looking frame appeared incapable of supplying. So they trotted on, and after a mile travelling at a foot’s pace after they got into close line, they reached the porte Maillot, and resigning the cab to the discretion of Agamemnon, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks got himself brushed over by one of the gentry who ply in that profession at all public places, and tucking his sword under one arm, he thrust the other through <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Stubbs’s, and, John-Bull-like, strutted up the long broad grass avenue, through the low part of the wood of <abbr>St.</abbr> Cloud, as if all he saw belonged to himself. The scene was splendid, and nature, art, and the weather appeared confederated for effect. On the lofty heights arose the stately place, looking down with placid grandeur on the full foliage of the venerable trees, over the beautiful gardens, the spouting fountains, the rushing cascades, and the gay and countless myriads that swarmed the avenues, while the circling river flowed calmly on, without a ripple on its surface, as if in ridicule of the sound of trumpets, the clang of cymbals, and the beat of drums, that rent the air around.</p>
			<p>Along the broad avenue were ranged shows of every description⁠—wild beasts, giants, jugglers, tumblers, mountebanks, and monsters, while in spots sheltered from the sun by lofty trees were dancing-places, swings, roundabouts, archery-butts, pistol-ranges, ball-kicking and head-thumping places, montagnes-Suisses, all the concomitants of fairs and fêtes⁠—beating “Bartlemy Fair,” as <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks candidly confessed, “all to nothing.”</p>
			<p>The chance of meeting the Countess Benvolio in such a multitude was very remote indeed, but, to tell the truth, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks never once thought of her, until having eat a couple of cold fowls and drank a bottle of porter, at an English booth, he felt in his pocket for his purse, and remembered it was in her keeping. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Stubbs, however, settled the account, and in high glee <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks resumed his peregrinations, visiting first one show, then another, shooting with pea-guns, then dancing a quadrille, until he was brought up short before a splendid green-and-gold roundabout, whose magic circle contained two lions, two swans, two black horses, a tiger, and a giraffe. “Let’s have a ride,” said he, jumping on to one of the black horses and adjusting the stirrups to his length. The party was soon made up, and as the last comer crossed his tiger, the engine was propelled by the boys in the centre, and away they went at Derby pace. In six rounds <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks lost his head, turned completely giddy, and bellowed out to them to stop. They took no heed⁠—all the rest were used to it⁠—and after divers yells and ineffectual efforts to dismount, he fell to the ground like a sack. The machine was in full work at the time, and swept round three or four times before they could stop it. At last <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Stubbs got to him, and a pitiable plight he was in. He had fallen on his head, broken his feather, crushed his chapeau bras, lost off his mustachios, was as pale as death, and very sick. Fortunately the accident happened near the gate leading to the town of <abbr>St.</abbr> Cloud, and thither, with the aid of two gendarmes, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Stubbs conveyed the fallen hero, and having put him to bed at the Hôtel d’Angleterre, he sent for a “médecin,” who of course shook his head, looked very wise, ordered him to drink warm water⁠—a never-failing specific in France⁠—and keep quiet. Finding he had an Englishman for a patient, the “médecin” dropped in every two hours, always concluding with the order “encore l’eau chaud.” A good sleep did more for <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks than the doctor, and when the “médecin” called in the morning, and repeated the injunction “encore l’eau chaud,” he bellowed out, “Cuss your <i xml:lang="fr">l’eau chaud</i>, my stomach ain’t a reserwoir! Give me some wittles!” The return of his appetite being a most favourable symptom, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Stubbs discharged the doctor, and forthwith ordered a <i xml:lang="fr">déjeuner à la fourchette</i>, to which <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks did pretty fair justice, though trifling in comparison with his usual performances. They then got into a Versailles diligence that stopped at the door, and rattling along at a merry pace, very soon reached Paris and the Rue des Mauvais-Garçons.</p>
			<p>“Come up and see the Countess,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks as they arrived at the bottom of the flight of dirty stairs, and, with his hands behind his back and his sword dragging at his heels, he poked upstairs, and opening the outer door entered the apartment. He passed through the small ante-room without observing his portmanteau and carpet-bag on the table, and there being no symptoms of the Countess in the next one, he walked forward into the bedroom beyond.</p>
			<p>Before an English fire-place that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks himself had been at the expense of providing, snugly ensconced in the luxurious depths of a well-cushioned easy chair, sat a monstrous man with a green patch on his right eye, in slippers, loose hose, a dirty grey woollen dressing-gown, and black silk nightcap, puffing away at a long meerschaum pipe, with a figure of Bacchus on the bowl. At a sight so unexpected <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks started back, but the smoker seemed quite unconcerned, and casting an unmeaning grey eye at the intruder, puffed a long-drawn respiration from his mouth.</p>
			<p>“How now!” roared <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks, boiling into a rage, which caused the monster to start upon his legs as though he were galvanised. “Vot brings you here?”</p>
			<p>“Sprechen sie Deutsch?” responded the smoker, opening his eye a little wider, and taking the pipe from his mouth. “Speak English, you fool,” bawled <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks. “Sie sind sehr unverschämt” (you are very impudent), replied the Dutchman with a thump on the table. “I’ll run you through the gizzard!” rejoined <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks, half drawing his sword⁠—“skin you alive, in fact!” when in rushed the Countess and threw herself between them.</p>
			<p>Now, Mynheer Van Rosembom, a burgomaster of Flushing, was an old friend of the Countess’s, and an exceedingly good paying one, and having cast up that morning quite unexpectedly by the early diligence from Dunkirk, and the Countess being enraged at <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks for not sharing the honours of his procession in the cab on the previous day, and believing, moreover, that his treasury was pretty well exhausted, thought she could not do better than instal Rosembom in his place, and retain the stakes she held for the Colonel’s board and lodging.</p>
			<p>This arrangement she kept to herself, simply giving Rosembom, who was not a much better Frenchman than <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Col.</abbr> Jorrocks, to understand that the room would be ready for him shortly, and Agamemnon was ordered to bundle <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks’s clothes into his portmanteau and bag, and place them in readiness in the ante-room. Rosembom, fatigued with his journey, then retired to enjoy his pipe at his ease, while the Countess went to the Marche <abbr>St.</abbr> Honoré to buy some sour crout, roast beef, and prunes for his dinner.</p>
			<p>“Turn this great slush-bucket out of my room!” cried <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks, as the Countess rushed into his apartment. “Vot’s he doing here?”</p>
			<p>“Doucement, mon cher Colonel,” said she, clapping him on the back, “he sall be my brodder.” “Never such a thing!” roared <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks, eyeing him as he spoke. “Never such a thing! no more than myself⁠—out with him, I say, or I’ll cut my stick⁠—<!-- TOO: incorrect french - still french? --><i xml:lang="fr">toute suite</i>⁠—directly!”</p>
			<p>“Avec tout mon coeur!” replied the Countess, her choler rising as she spoke. “You’re another,” rejoined <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks, judging by her manner that she called him something offensive⁠—“Vous ête one mauvaise woman!” “Monsieur,” said the Countess, her eyes flashing as she spoke, “vous êtes un polisson!⁠—von rascal!⁠—von dem villain!⁠—un charlatan!⁠—von nasty⁠—bastely⁠—ross bif!⁠—dem dog!” and thereupon she curled her fingers and set her teeth on edge as though she would tear his very eyes out. Rosembom, though he didn’t exactly see the merits of the matter, exchanged his pipe for the poker, so what with this, the sword, and the nails, things wore a very belligerent aspect.</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Stubbs, as usual, interposed, and the Countess, still keeping up the semblance of her rage, ordered them to quit her apartment directly, or she would have recourse to her old friends the police. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Stubbs was quite agreeable to go, but he hinted that she might as well hand over the stakes that had been entrusted to her keeping on the previous day, upon which she again indulged in a torrent of abuse, swore they were a couple of thieves, and that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks owed her far more than the amount for board and lodging. This made the Colonel stare, for on the supposition that he was a visitor, he had been firing away his money in all directions, playing at everything she proposed, buying her bonnets, Perigord pies, hiring remises, and committing every species of extravagance, and now to be charged for what he thought was pure friendship, disgusted him beyond expression.</p>
			<p>The Countess speedily summoned the porter, the man of letters of the establishment, and with his aid drew <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks out a bill, which he described as “reaching down each side of his body and round his waist,” commencing with 2 francs for savon, and then proceeding in the daily routine of café, 1 franc; déjeuner à la fourchette, 5 francs; diner avec vin, 10 francs; tea, 1 franc; souper, 3 francs; bougies, 2 francs; appartement, 3 francs; running him up a bill of 700 francs; and when <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Stubbs remonstrated on the exorbitance of the charges, she replied, “It sall be, sare, as small monnaie as sail be consistent avec my dignified respectability, you to charge.”</p>
			<p>There seemed no help for the matter, so <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Stubbs paid the balance, while <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks, shocked at the duplicity of the Countess, the impudence of Rosembom, and the emptiness of his own pockets, bolted away without saying a word.</p>
			<p>That very night the Malle-Poste bore them from the capital, with two cold fowls, three-quarters of a yard of bread, and a bottle of porter, for <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks on the journey, and ere another sun went down, the sandy suburbs of Calais saw them toiling towards her ramparts, and rumbling over the drawbridges and under the portcullis, that guard the entrance to her gloomy town. Calais! cold, cheerless, lifeless Calais! Whose soul has ever warmed as it approached thy town? but how many hearts have turned with sickening sorrow from the mirthless tinkling of thy bells!</p>
			<p>“We’ll not stay here long I guess,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks as the diligence pulled up at the post-office, and the conducteur requested the passengers to descend. “That’s optional,” said a bystander, who was waiting for his letters, looking at <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks with an air as much as to say, what a rum-looking fellow you are, and not without reason, for the Colonel was attired in a blue sailor’s jacket, white leathers, and jack-boots, with the cocked hat and feather. The speaker was a middle-aged, middle-statured man, with a quick intelligent eye, dressed in a single-breasted green riding-coat, striped toilinette waistcoat, and drab trousers, with a whip in his hand. “Thank you for nothing!” replied <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks, eyeing him in return, upon which the speaker turned to the clerk and asked if there were any letters for Monsieur Apperley or Nimrod. “<strong>Nimrod</strong>!” exclaimed <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks, dropping on his knees as though he were shot. “Oh my vig what have I done? Oh dear! oh dear! what a dumbfounderer⁠—flummoxed I declare!”</p>
			<p>“Hold up! old ’un,” said Nimrod in astonishment; “why, what’s the matter now? You don’t owe me anything I dare say!”</p>
			<p>“Owe you anything! yes, I does,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks, rising from the ground, “I owes you a debt of gratitude that I can never wipe off⁠—you’ll be in the day-book and ledger of my memory for ever and a year.”</p>
			<p>“Who are you?” inquired Nimrod, becoming more and more puzzled, as he contrasted his dialect with his dress.</p>
			<p>“Who am I? Why, I’m Mister Jorrocks.”</p>
			<p>“Jorrocks, by Jove! Who’d have thought it! I declare I took you for a horse-marine. Give us your hand, old boy. I’m proud to make your acquaintance.”</p>
			<p>“Ditto to you, sir, twice repeated. I considers you the werry first man of the age!”⁠—and thereupon they shook hands with uncommon warmth.</p>
			<p>“You’ve been in Paris, I suppose,” resumed Nimrod, after their respective digits were released; “were you much gratified with what you saw? What pleased you most⁠—the Tuileries, Louvre, Garden of Plants, Père la Chaise, Notre Dame, or what?”</p>
			<p>“Why now, to tell you the truth, singular as it may seem, I saw nothing but the Tuileries and Naughty Dame.⁠—I may say a werry naughty dame, for she fleeced me uncommonly, scarcely leaving me a dump to carry me home.”</p>
			<p>“What, you’ve been among the ladies, have you? That’s gay for a man at your time of life.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, I certainlie have been among the ladies⁠—countesses I may say⁠—but, dash my vig, they are a rum set, and made me pay for their acquaintance. The Countess Benwolio certainlie is a bad ’un.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, the deuce!⁠—did that old devil catch you?” inquired Nimrod.</p>
			<p>“Vot, do you know her?”</p>
			<p>“Know her! ay⁠—everybody here knows her with her black boy. She’s always on the road, and lives now by the flats she catches between Paris and the coast. She was an agent for Morison’s Pills⁠—but having a fractious Scotch lodger that she couldn’t get out, she physicked him so dreadfully that he nearly died, and the police took her licence away. But you are hungry, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks, come to my house and spend the evening, and tell me all about your travels.”</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Stubbs objected to this proposition, having just learned that the London packet sailed in an hour, so the trio adjourned to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Roberts’s, Royal Hotel, where over some strong eau-de-vie they cemented their acquaintance, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks, finding that Nimrod was to be in England the following week, insisted upon his naming a day for dining in Great Coram Street.</p>
			<p>“Permits” to embark having been considerately granted “gratis” by the Government for a franc apiece, at the hour of ten our travellers stepped on board, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jorrocks, having wrapped himself up in his martial cloak, laid down in the cabin and, like Ulysses in Ithaca, as Nimrod would say, “arrived in London Asleep.”</p>
